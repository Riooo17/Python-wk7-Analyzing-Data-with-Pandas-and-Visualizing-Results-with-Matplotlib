# Iris Dataset Analysis 🌸

This project explores the famous **Iris dataset** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
It includes data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `iris_data_analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis (code + outputs + plots).  
- `README.md` → This file, with project description and instructions.  

---

## 📝 Tasks Covered
### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Inspected the first few rows.
- Checked data types and missing values.
- Cleaned dataset (though Iris has no missing values).

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Computed summary statistics (`.describe()`).
- Grouped data by **species** and calculated mean petal length.
- Observed key patterns (Setosa has smallest petals, Virginica the largest).

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Created 4 different plots:
1. **Line Chart** → Sepal length trend by index.  
2. **Bar Chart** → Average petal length per species.  
3. **Histogram** → Distribution of sepal width.  
4. **Scatter Plot** → Sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species.

## 📊 Example Plots
(When viewed in Jupyter Notebook or PDF, you’ll see plots like these:)  

- Bar chart comparing average petal length per species  
- Scatter plot showing separation between Iris species
